1. THIS IS THE WORKLOG FOR PROJECT FOR THE ASSIGNMENT TOPIC Personal Expense Tracker:

2. MY VERY FIRST APPROACH WAS TO MAKE A CHATBOT LIKE STRUCTURE WHERE USER ENTERS HIS/HER QUERY AND AI WOULD AUTOMATICALLY USE ITS BRAIN TO DETERMINE THE CATEGORY DESCRIPTION AND DATE ETC
3. THE CHATBOT WOULD HAVE MEMORY OF EVERY QURIED THING AND WHEN CONVERSATION IS OVER/USER ASKS FOR SUMMARY IT SUMMARIZES THE WHOLE WEEK/MONTH CONTENT
4. THIS THING WAS VERY PLAIN CAUSE IT DOESNT STORE IN GOOD FORMAT AND WOULD CREATE CLASHES AND ALSO CATEGORY WAS DYNAMIC LIKE MADE ON THE SPOT WHICH WOULD ALSO BE BAD EXAMPLE IN REAL LIFE
5. SO I THOUGHT OF THE PROCESS OF MAKING CATEGORY PREDETERMINED BY ENHANCING PROMPT INJECTION SO AI WOULD ONLY PICK ON CATEGORY FROM THE LIST OF CATEGORY ALREADY PROVIDED
6. THIS IMPROVED ITS EFFICIENCY BUT STILL MORE TO ENHANCE

7. SO I ASKED GPT FOR IDEA ON HOW TO ENHANCE EXPERIENCE SO IT TOLD ME TO DITCH CHATBOT IDEA AND MAKE A SIMPLE FRONTEND WHERE USER WILL ENTER ITS QUERY
8. IDEA WAS GOOD AND I ALSO MADE SUMMARY BUTTON WHICH WOULD SUMMARIZ IN GOOD FORMAT
9. BUT I THOUGHT TO ENHANCE EXPERIENCE TO I HAD IDEA TO APPLY TABLES AND EVEN BARGRAPH FOR BETTER EXPERIENCE WHERE USER CAN SEE WHAT IT ADDED AT THE TIME AND WOULD ALSO CHANGE DYNAMICALLY
10. THE BAR GRAPH WAS ALSO DYNAMIC AND WOULD UPDATE BASED ON THE QUERY
11. I ALSO ADDED TOTAL EXPENSE FOR FEASIBILITY
12. AND IN THE FINAL I HAD IDEA OF MAKING A SUMMARY INTO PDF FOR VERY EASY ACCESS AND ABLE SO SHARE QUICKLY

13. HERE THE PROBLEM LIED IN PDF ONE I WAS CONSTANTLY GETTIG ERROR RELATED TO MARKDOWN AND SPENT 10MIN FUXING IT AND IN THE FINAL ASKED GPT CAUSE OF ERRO AND WHAT SHOULD I DO SO IT TOLD ME IT IS DUE TO STREAMLIT.MARKDOWN AND TOLD ME ANOTHER APPROACH WHICH WORKED FANTASTICALLY
14. NOW IN DURING THE DEPLOYMENT I REALISED I HAD LOCAL LLAMA3 MODEL WHICH CANT BE DEPLOYED SO I SHIFTED TO GEMINI API KEY AND DEPLOYED ON STREAMLIT CLOUD AND ADDED IT INTO SECRET KEYS
15. WHEN I RAN THIS IT CAUSED ERROR FOR 15MINUTES STRAIGHT BECAUSE OF THE PROMPT I IMPORTED IN MAIN.PY FILE EVERYTHING WAS FINE BUT STILL ERROR PERSISTED SO I RESTART :) AND VOILA IT FIXED IDK HOW BUT IT DID
16. ALSO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I FACED WAS CONVERTING PROMPT INTO GOOD STRUCUTRED OUTPUT BECAUSE MY LLAMA3 WAS VERY WEAK IN THIS SCENARIO SO I SPENT LOT TIME IN PROMPT INJECTION TOO

TOOK APPROX 5 HOURS
